  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>My name is <b>Kevin Kindorf</b> and I'm a reference librarian in an urban public library. Now what exactly does that mean? On a daily basis I help dozens of adults and children navigate multiple web programs on a daily basis. I also maintain most of the content on the library's website while also promoting some of the library's programs on our social media pages too. I could also be purchasing new video games or science books for the library's collection. All of this on top of the dozens of other things that I shouldn't list here or I'll risk boring you for too long.  
  <p>Anyway, after taking an HTML and CSS class in graduate school and updating alot of the content on the library's website as we transition to a new site using Drupal, I realize <b>I really like coding!</b> Once I made my first Python game while working through Zed Shaw's <i>Learn Python the Hard Way</i>, I thought to myself, holey crap! I can write computer programs too! I knew then that I actually had a chance at becoming a successful web developer.<p>

  <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
  <p>I've lived in Massachusetts since forever. I live in <b>Framingham, Ma</b> in particular. I grew up in a large family where my parents pushed my siblings and I to pursue our educational interests.</p>
<p>This motivation has led me to be a life long learner. My never ending desire to learn and the consistent motivation towards education from my parents are two of the main driving factors, that are going to help me succeed as a future professional web developer.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>

  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>

<p>I am an avid gardener! There is nothing more satisfying than eating a fresh vegetable straight from the vine. I am also really into golf, even though my handicap isn't all that great.</p>

  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>

<p>My dream job would be to work for an organization that's dedicated to creating free and engaging educational websites and software for all ages.</p>

  <h2>What's your background?</h2>
<p>I have been working in libraries for the past five years and non-profit organizations as well. For the past two years I have been able to use my skills in HTML and CSS to maintain my employers' content on their websites using Drupal, Dreamweaver, WordPress and Cushy. However, now that I am participating in Thinkful's Front End Development course, I am hoping to advance my abilities in web development further so I can break into the industry.</p>
  

  <h2>What are you reading right now?</h2>
  <p>I'm currently reading <i>Stiff</i> by Mary Roach. It's an insightful and comedic book focusing on the "life" of human cadavers.</p>
